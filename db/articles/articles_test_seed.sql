    'This marks the end of gun control', 
'The federal government has finally recognized the obvious - that sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech. Despite little fanfare, this is an important victory for First Amendment rights. It also represents a real blow to the increasingly futile cause of gun control. The U.S. Justice Department announced a legal settlement and its surrender to the First Amendment arguments July 10 made in a case brought by Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed. Wilson, 25, created a ruckus in May 2013 when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun. In just two days, 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint were downloaded from Wilson''s website. The most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany. The heavy downloading in Spain, Brazil and Germany likely reflected attempts to evade extremely restrictive handgun regulations in those countries. People are going to download these files whether they''re legal or not. As we''ve seen with movies, file sharing is unstoppable. The most pirated TV program in 2017 was the seventh season of "Game of Thrones," with well over 10 million illegal downloads in most weeks. Within days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls. Wilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading. Within a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world. The Justice Department''s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions "for public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form." The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilson''s legal costs. Someone has just as much right to release the instructions in a computer file as in a book or newspaper article. The groups that submitted arguments on Wilson''s behalf were ideologically diverse, ranging from conservative self-defense advocacy groups to the Reporters'' Committee for Freedom of the Press and Electronic Frontier Foundation. Anyone with access to a metal 3D printer can make guns functionally and aesthetically indistinguishable from any gun that can be bought in a store. Such metal printers are available for less than $2,000. How the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn''t exactly obvious. Proposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated. Even if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them? And the designs for making your own printer have been available on the Internet for years. 3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible. The government is not going to be able to ban guns, and limits on the size of bullet magazines will be even more laughable than before. Many parts of a gun can be made on very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even from simple machine tools. It will be even more difficult to impose background checks, which have proven quite useless anyway. The government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs. That isn''t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns. The goal of eliminating guns is ultimately a fool''s errand. Every place in the world that we have crime data for that has banned all guns or all handguns has seen a subsequent increase in murder rates. Even island nations such as Ireland and Jamaica - with coastlines that are more easily monitored and defended than land borders would be - have faced five- or six-fold increases in murder rates after guns were banned. It is understandable that governments want to regulate 3D printing, but gutting the First Amendment is too high a cost. This settlement may bring some awareness to the futility of gun control regulations that only disarm the law-abiding.',

    'All your questions about 3D guns answered',
    'Not long ago, it was the stuff of science fiction, but now US officials and lawmakers are grappling with a new reality -- citizens having the ability to print firearms at home. A gun rights group blocked downloads of 3D gun plans from its website Tuesday after a federal judge sided with states arguing that the postings could help criminals and terrorists manufacture such weapons.3D gun plans website suspends downloads after court rulingWhile Judge Robert Lasnik''s ruling didn''t order the plans taken down, it temporarily blocked a settlement reached in June between Defense Distributed, a Texas-based gun rights organization, and the federal government that made it legal to post 3D printable gun plans online. "This is a nationwide ban. ... It takes us back to a period of time before the federal government flipped on their policy regarding these 3D ghost guns," Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said. So what''s the controversy all about? Here some answers to your questions.Read MoreJust what are 3D-printed guns?3D guns are firearms assembled from ABS plastic parts -- the same material found in Legos -- that can be made with a 3D printer. The Defense Distributed website would have allowed people to download plans for building a variety of 3D guns, including an AR-15-style rifle, a Beretta M9 handgun and other firearms.How do you print a 3D gun?3D printing uses computer-created digital models to create real-world objects, from simple chess pieces to more complex objects such as functioning clocks. The printers follow the shape of the model by stacking layer upon layer of plastic or other material to make the objects. How hard is it to print one?"Even machinists with average skills are able to produce 3D printed firearms," said Mitch Free, chairman & CEO of the 3D printing company ZYCI CNC Machining. He said 3D printing is more accessible than ever because of software improvements and some slight reductions in the cost of 3D scanners and fabrication tools.Can anybody do it?You''ll need some money. The higher-end 3D printers needed to make such weapons cost thousands of dollars and may be too expensive for most people. Of course that doesn''t ease the concerns of those who think guns made from 3D printers are a bad idea.So why are some people against them?Critics fear the DIY guns could create security concerns because they are untraceable and would largely be invisible to metal detectors. They also fear the technology makes it far too easy for terrorists and people who are too dangerous to pass criminal background checks to get their hands on guns.What do defenders of these guns say?Cody Wilson -- the founder of Defense Distributed and the person who introduced the world to 3D-printed guns -- and his supporters say the ability to build unregulated and untraceable guns will make it much harder, if not impossible, for governments to ban them. Wilson also sees this fight as a free speech issue. By suing the government for violating his First Amendment rights, he shifted the focus of the debate about 3D printed guns away from gun control to a discussion about access to data and information online.Why did the US government intervene?A few days after Defense Distributed posted its instructions for making a "Liberator" plastic gun in 2013, the US State Department sent a three-page cease-and-desist letter to Wilson demanding that the group remove them from its website. It accused Wilson of potentially breaching International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which regulate the export of defense materials, services and technical data. In essence, officials said, someone in another country that the United States doesn''t sell weapons to could download the material and make guns.What do lawmakers say about this?In December 2013, a federal law requiring that all guns be detectable by metal screening machines was extended for another 10 years.The law prohibits guns that don''t contain enough metal to trigger screening machines commonly found in airports, courthouses and other secure areas accessible to the public.JUST WATCHEDPompeo commits to reviewing 3D-printed gun policyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH Pompeo commits to reviewing 3D-printed gun policy 00:54Plastic gun designs got around this restriction by adding a removable metal block, which isn''t required for the firearm to function.In June, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced a bill in the Senate that would amend the Undetectable Firearms Act to prohibit firearms that do not have a major component that can be detected at airport security screening.How effective are the guns?In 2013, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives made public tests it has done on the Liberator model.Fears grow over 3D-printed guns, gun made with a plastic called ABS-M30 fired a .380-caliber round without failing all eight times it was tested, ATF officials said, describing it as "a lethal weapon." Another pistol made from a plastic called VisiJet didn''t perform as well, with video showing it exploding into a dozen plastic shards when fired.Where does the case stand now?The issue will go back to court on August 10, when both sides will argue over whether a preliminary injunction is needed. *(New''s agencys) Douglas Criss and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.',

    'Kavanaugh confirmation hearing turns into outrageous Senate circus',
    'The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus went out of business last year, but it found a successor Tuesday on Capitol Hill as Democrats and demonstrators performed at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, commenting on repeated outbursts by demonstrators and steady string of complaints by Democratic senators, said that "this is something I''ve never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations." The political theatrics kicked into high gear right out of the gate. Grassley wasn''t more than three lines into his opening statement when, one by one, Democrats attempted to hijack the hearing with calls for more of Kavanaugh''s documents, and even a motion to adjourn the hearing altogether. The Democratic objections were absurd. Judge Kavanaugh - currently serving on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia - is the most transparent Supreme Court nominee in recent history. As Grassley stated Tuesday, an astounding 488,000 pages of documents relating to Kavanaugh have been released. For comparison, Justice Elena Kagan - who served in the Obama administration as solicitor general before she joined the high court - only had about 70,000 pages of documents released when she went through her confirmation hearing in 2010. About 182,000 pages of documents were released when the Senate confirmed President Trump''s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year. Kavanaugh also submitted the most comprehensive bipartisan questionnaire in Senate Judiciary Committee history. Also, as Grassley pointed out in the hearing, Kavanaugh has written 307 opinions as an appellate court judge and he was nominated on July 9. Democrats have plenty of reading material, and they''ve had plenty of time to read it. Many Democrats read enough within the first few days of Kavanaugh''s nomination to go on record opposing his nomination. And you can bet they would have opposed whoever President Trump nominated for the Supreme Court opening created by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Democrats are engaged in nothing more than a desperate effort to delay a confirmation vote on Kavanaugh until next year, when they hope to control the Senate by winning a majority in the November midterm elections. Their stalling tactics have nothing to do with Kavanaugh''s qualifications - they have everything to do with the anti-Trump resistance and turning out the Democratic base to vote in November. But Democrats up for re-election in November in states carried by President Trump in the 2016 election - and where he remains popular today - are under pressure to support Kavanaugh''s nomination to keep their jobs. Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota could wind up supporting Kavanaugh''s confirmation for this reason. All three senators voted to confirm Gorsuch when President Trump nominated him. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., whose top goal is to elect a Democratic majority in the chamber, would be foolish to pressure them to vote against Kavanaugh if it led to their electoral defeat two months from now. Depending on Kavanaugh''s performance this week, pressure could also build on Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Bill Nelson of Florida to vote to confirm Kavanaugh, since both are in tight re-election races. For other Senate Democrats, this week will be less about defeating Kavanaugh and more about raising their profile for the 2020 presidential election. Among the pool of likely Senate Democratic presidential hopefuls are Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, who both serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Look for them to use the hearings as a launching pad for their possible presidential campaigns. It''s widely speculated that Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will also run for president in 2020. She''ll likely be headed for a TV camera every time there''s a break in the hearing. It''s guaranteed the media will be happy to give her the free ad time. Call it fearmongering or desperation, but the outrage among Senate Democrats began months ago. In the case of Harris, it was before Kavanaugh was even chosen as the nominee. On MSNBC''s "Hardball" she said of whoever President Trump would pick: "We''re looking at a destruction of the Constitution of the United States." No need to know the nominee''s name or look at his record. Harris knew enough. Yet, she was the first one to obstruct the hearing and feign outrage Tuesday morning because 488,000 documents weren''t enough reading material for her. No irony to see here. In a July press conference Booker said of those supporting Judge Kavanaugh: "You are either complicit in the evil, you are either contributing to the wrong, or you are fighting against it." He then had a kumbaya moment and instead called for everyone to love one another. Still, barring anything unforeseen happening at his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed by the end of the month and seated when the Supreme Court reconvenes in October. So get the popcorn ready and expect to see more political theater throughout this week. Democrats will move on to Act II with their political posturing and outrage on full display. Who needs the Ringling Bros. circus when we have the Senate circus?',

    'Partisan shouting marks first day of Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing',
    'Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court pick who could tilt American jurisprudence to the right for a generation, vowed to be neutral and impartial, shrugging off bitter Democratic demands for him to stall his own confirmation hearing until questions about his past are fully answered. President Donald Trump''s second pick for the nation''s highest court sat silently for much of the day as Democrats staged an aggressive, coordinated effort to slow his apparent march to confirmation -- in exchanges that highlighted several potential 2020 presidential contenders, including California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. In addition, Capitol Police said they made 70 arrests Tuesday for protests during the hearing and in other parts of Capitol Hill. After seven hours of political sparring mostly aimed by senators at their constituencies outside the hearing room, Kavanaugh finally got the chance to speak, and delivered emotional tributes to members of his family and his friends -- but resolved none of the issues that Democrats say should derail his nomination. In a comment that seemed to fly in the face of a day of political estrangement, he warned that the Supreme Court "must never be viewed as a partisan institution" and argued that "a good judge must be an umpire -- a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy." Democrats angrily accused the White House and Republicans of hiding key details about Kavanaugh''s time as a Bush-era White House lawyer by refusing to publicly release tens of thousands of documents. They also decried a dump of 42,000 documents on Monday night, hours before the hearing. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, put the issue directly to Kavanaugh: "For the sake of this nation, for the sanctity of the Constitution that we both honor, step up, ask this meeting, this gathering to suspend until all the documents of your public career are there for the American people to see." Kavanaugh, Trump''s second Supreme Court nominee, is poised to succeed swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, the conservative-centrist who joined with liberals in some key decisions to uphold abortion rights. Kennedy was also the decisive vote for same-sex marriage and university affirmative action. Trump, watching the hearings from the White House, lashed out at Democrats for attacking Kavanaugh, whose arrival on the Supreme Court bench would represent a historic triumph for the President. "The Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is. They will say anything, and are only....looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!" Trump tweeted. His hardball language contrasted with the optimistic cadence of the closing remarks from Kavanaugh, who likely faces an even more contentious day when senators begin to ply him with questions on Wednesday. "I live on the sunny side of the mountain," Kavanaugh said. Democrats open with a flurry The hearing opened with an hour of squabbling between Democrats and Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, that was punctuated by screaming protests from the public gallery as anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators were bundled out by Capitol Police. The theatrics reflect the impotence of Democrats who lack the votes in the Senate to block Kavanaugh''s confirmation. It is not even certain all Democrats will stick together since endangered liberal senators up for re-election in red states are under intense pressure to back the confirmation. The clashes in the hearing were part of a long awaited political spectacle. But consistent with the uproar of the Trump era, Kavanaugh was upstaged even before he delivered his opening statement, as stunning revelations began to emerge of a new book by veteran reporter Bob Woodward that portrays Trump as a grave threat to national security and raging and incompetent. "What are we trying to hide, why are we rushing?" Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked as the hearing began. But Grassley denied Democratic attempts to get a vote in the committee on whether to adjourn the hearing, and complaints that the late arrival of the documents and other controversies flew in the face of committee rules and basic fairness. "This is something I have never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations. I was interrupted before I got a chance to say the agenda for today," said Grassley. Republican Sen John Cornyn of Texas complained the hearing was being overtaken by "mob rule" His colleague Orrin Hatch from Utah demanded that a "loudmouth" protester who was drowning out his remarks should be removed. Kavanaugh watched the arguments in the committee with a bemused look on his face, with his pen poised over a white legal pad. When the hearing turned from controversy over process to substance, Durbin thrust home the meat of the Democratic case. "You are the nominee of President Donald John Trump. This is a President who has shown us consistently that he is contemptuous of the rule of law," Durbin said. "It''s that President who has decided you are his man." A "umpire judge" Kavanaugh''s use of the umpire analogy to refer to the duties of a judge recalled Chief Justice John Roberts'' confirmation hearing back in 2005, when he said his "job is to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat." He also praised Kennedy, who announced his retirement earlier this summer. "As Justice Kennedy showed us, a judge must be independent, not swayed by public pressure. Our independent Judiciary is the crown jewel of our Constitutional republic" Kavanaugh said. "If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine." Kavanaugh, currently a circuit judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, also praised his colleague Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama''s unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee, as a "superb chief judge." The hearing will continue Wednesday morning with questions from senators.',

    'Trump declares "market would crash" if Democrats impeached him',
    'President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News'' Ainsley Earhardt, warned that the "market would crash" if he''s ever impeached -- while questioning why Democrats would even consider that course in the future. "I don''t know how you can impeach somebody who''s done a great job," Trump said, in the interview which aired Thursday on "Fox & Friends." The president weighed in on calls from the left to pursue impeachment if Democrats seize the House in the midterms. That speculation kicked up following the plea deal struck by his former attorney Michael Cohen claiming the president was involved in hush-money payments and admitting campaign finance violations related to them. The president argued that he''s done a great job in office, despite the critical coverage in connection with the Cohen case and other controversies. Further, he warned, "If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor, because without this thinking, you would see -- you would see numbers that you wouldn''t believe in reverse." The president touted his economic accomplishments, claiming that the economy was going to be "down" if he hadn''t been elected. "I freed up, I got rid of regulations, the tax cut was a tremendous thing," Trump said. He added: "Had Hillary and the Democrats gotten in, had she been president, you would have had negative growth. We picked up $10 trillion worth." Impeachment talk is still confined to certain corners of the Democratic Party. Top House Democrats have largely pushed back on calls to pursue that option, though some have kept the door open. Many Democrats have said the Cohen plea creates legal risks for Trump. "The factual basis of the plea, potentially implicating the president in illegal campaign finance violations, adds to the president''s legal jeopardy," Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top House Intelligence Committee Democrat, said in a statement. The president also hit on immigration in the interview -- saying "we''re doing a record-breaking job, but we have bad laws." "You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws. So they''ll all get changed, but we have to elect more Republicans," Trump said. The president was asked about the murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, whom he called "a beautiful young girl." "She was killed by a horrible person that came in from Mexico, illegally here. Found by ICE, our great ICE who''s abused by the Democrats and the left. And without them, you might not be sitting here so comfortably right now. I just think it''s so sad," Trump said. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, in the U.S. illegally from Mexico, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday in Tibbetts'' death. He is currently being held on a federal immigration detainer. "We''re building the wall. It''s already started. We''ve spent $3.2 billion on it. We''re asking for $5 billion for this year''s funding. The wall is going up. A lot of people don''t know it," Trump said. He added that he would "like to build it even faster," but said working with the Democrats is "very tough." "We''re doing an incredible job," Trump said. The president said he would give himself and his presidency, thus far, an "A plus." "I don''t think any president has ever done what I''ve done in this short, we haven''t even been two years, biggest tax cuts in history, soon-to-be two unbelievable Supreme Court justices -- I''m sure that Justice Kavanaugh will be approved, Justice Gorsuch has been a star," Trump said. "You look at all of the things we''ve done with regulations, the economy is the best it''s ever been in history." Trump announced Brett Kavanaugh as his choice to replace retired Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on the bench. His confirmation hearing is expected in the Senate in early September, though some Democrats are pushing for delays after the Cohen plea. The one area where Trump said he was not succeeding was with the media. "The only thing I''m doing badly on is the press doesn''t cover me fairly," Trump said. "I thought after I won, you know, they killed me during the campaign. Just killed me. I said well, one good thing about winning, I''ve showed them, so now I''m going to get fair press." He added: "Guess what, it got worse. It''s worse." The president has routinely mocked and attacked media outlets -- like CNN, NBC, The New York Times, and The Washington Post -- over critical stories that he often disputes. Last week, more than 300 publications across the country participated in coordinated editorial columns promoting freedom of the press and criticizing Trump. Trump went on to criticize the media coverage of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, last month. "My meeting with Putin was a tremendous success, I got killed by the fake news," Trump said. "They wanted me to go up and punch him in the face. I said I want to get along with Russia. I want to get along with everybody." He added: "They said I was too rough on North Korea, remember that, too rough. But with Putin, they said I was too soft." The president angered members of both parties at the Putin summit by saying both countries share blame for damaged relations and by not firmly standing by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. Trump praised his wife, Melania Trump, for her grace through negative media coverage of the first family and his administration. "She is doing great. She''s a terrific woman. She goes through a lot with all this publicity. But she''s a terrific woman, she''s doing great," Trump said, adding that unfavorable coverage and publicity is "part of my life." He added: "I''ve always won. I''ve always won. It was controversial when I ran, and I won, and now the country''s doing better than it''s ever done."',

    'How would the stock market react if Trump is impeached? Economists weigh in',
    'The interview followed last week''s conviction of Paul Manafort, Trump''s one-time campaign manager, and the guilty plea of Michael Cohen, the president''s former personal lawyer. We asked three economists -- M. Todd Henderson, Eric Zitzewitz and Larry Hatheway -- to weigh in on how the market might react if Trump gets the boot. M. Todd Henderson is a professor of law and economics at the University of Chicago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Political games in Washington typically don''t matter very much on Wall Street. The fundamental value of a stock is based on the cash that the underlying company is expected to generate over its lifetime, discounted to present value. Therefore, the value of the stock market is simply the sum of the values of all the individual stocks (or, for an index, like the Dow, the value of the stocks in the index). If businesses expect to make more money, more investors will buy than sell, driving up stock prices. What''s more, the probability of a political event like an impeachment is already baked into the stock price of every company. Markets (meaning buyers and sellers of stock) are constantly adjusting their estimates based on news of all kinds, whether it''s about consumer demand for a particular product, tariffs, the president''s latest tweet or even his impeachment. The prices of stocks today reflects these estimates. Notably, markets didn''t move at all on the news of Manafort''s conviction and Cohen''s guilty plea. This means the market as a whole does not believe Trump will be impeached, or knows that Trump''s impeachment wouldn''t have a big impact on the value of American businesses. Investors could also think a President Pence with a Democratic-controlled House (and even Senate) might be good for business. Even if Trump is impeached, his tax cuts for corporations and the rollback of regulations are not likely to be reversed for many years should Pence become president. Eric Zitzewitz is a professor of economics at Dartmouth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. There was already a low probability that President Trump would finish his term, then get renominated and be reelected, according to betting markets at Betfair. So last week''s news of Manafort''s conviction and Cohen''s guilty plea caused his odds of finishing the term and of being renominated to drop even further (from 70.4% to 63.3% and from 70.0% to 60.6%, respectively). But the stock market has seemed remarkably unaffected. When last Wednesday''s news broke, the S&P 500 was basically flat. To dig a little deeper, we can look at stocks that are expected to especially benefit from Trump. The Trump Long-Short Policy Index is an index I designed in collaboration with Raymond Fisman of Boston University. It tracks the difference in returns between stocks that rallied when Trump was elected and those that fell at that time. When Trump met with congressional leaders Nov. 10, 2016 and confirmed his intention of pursuing a Republican agenda, it rose. When Manafort was indicted in 2017, the index saw a statistically significant drop, but rallied one month later when the Senate passed the tax cuts. The index''s swings can be used to scale the importance of an event. For example, the fact that the index lost about 10% of its post-election gains when Manafort was indicted means that the markets estimated the indictment undid about 10% of the expected effects of Trump''s election, at least as it pertains to economic policy that matters for publicly traded firms. Conversely, the large index rally that occurred when the tax cuts passed indicated that these cuts were a significant component of what investors expected Trump to deliver. In contrast to these prior events, our index barely moved on last Wednesday''s news. Not only was the increased probability of an early departure for Trump not a big deal for the aggregate market, it also appears not to matter much for individual stocks either. Why? The explanation may lie in the fact that last week''s news also did not have much affect on Trump''s odds of reelection (which fell from 38.2% to 36.2%) or of the GOP keeping the House in 2018 (which fell from 35.7% to 35.2%). Realistically, Trump is probably done passing most of his economic policy anyway. The key uncertainty now is how much of his policy will last. Ironically, while impeachment is clearly bad for Trump himself, if it divides the country, it may reduce the likelihood that a blue wave large enough to overturn the GOP and his policies will arise. Larry Hatheway is group chief economist at GAM Holding AG. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. The most important driver of the US stock markets remains the US economy. The Trump administration''s achievements in delivering significant tax cuts and lighter-touch regulation clearly supported the S&P 500''s solid advance in 2017. But as much as any administration wants to take credit for solid economic growth and a rising stock market, the fact is that these trends were clearly underway before the 2016 election. For this reason, the simple act of impeachment won''t erode the fundamentals that have pushed the S&P 500 to record highs this year. Since 2010, the share of US corporate profits in the nation''s gross domestic product has attained levels never before seen in the post-war era. Low corporate borrowing costs courtesy of the Fed''s monetary policy easing since the 2008 financial crisis has cut debt servicing costs and boosted the bottom line. At the end of the Great Recession, profits jumped even more than usual, given that US firms shed far more jobs -- and hence costs -- during the recession than typical. That allowed firms to increase profits rapidly once sales began to pick up. But other factors have been at work as well. The emergence of dominant players in key industries -- like Apple, Google and Microsoft in the tech space -- has created firms able to earn "supernormal" profits. Lastly, various factors have diminished the bargaining power of labor, including globalization, labor-saving technologies and the long-term decline of union power. As a result, wage growth has been tepid. And since wages and benefits make up over two-thirds of the total costs of the average US company, the diminished bargaining power of labor has been a key driver of historically high profits. All of this has helped cut costs and drive corporate earnings even higher. Thanks to this rampant corporate profit growth, companies flush with cash have been hiring strongly for eight years. The US unemployment rate peaked at 10.1% in October 2009. By the end of the Obama administration it had fallen to 4.8%. Now it stands at 3.9%. While Trump''s 2017 tax cuts have clearly provided a lift to the economy, the pace of job growth has slowed in the first two years of the Trump administration relative to the last four years of the Obama administration. In part, that reflects a more fully employed US economy -- talented workers are not as readily available as they were five years ago. But this combination of strong job growth and rising company earnings has made the US economy more resilient to all manner of shocks, even political ones. So would impeachment -- and removal -- of a standing US president cause the market to crash? Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974. It was during a time of increased economic uncertainty, thanks to rising inflation that led to a "lost decade" for US investors. In the 1970s, inflation had a far larger and longer-lasting impact on investment performance than Nixon''s resignation. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, but he was not removed from office. For investors, the tech bubble of the late 1990s was of far greater importance. Following the 1998 emerging market meltdown, equity markets surged as the Fed eased monetary policy and investors scrambled to buy Internet stocks. Clinton''s Impeachment barely caused a ripple. We can draw lessons from history. Most importantly, the health of the economy and corporate profits largely determine how stock markets perform. Today, the greatest risk for investors remains a destabilizing escalation of trade conflict or an unanticipated surge in US inflation, which would force the Fed to tighten aggressively.',

    'Bernie Sanders, Amazon clash over his "inaccurate" accusations about "low" employee pay',
    'Former McDonald''s USA CEO Ed Rensi on Anaheim officially ends tax breaks for Disneyland, the minimum wage hike debate and the Trump administration''s trade deal with Mexico. The fight between e-commerce giant Amazon and Sen. Bernie Sanders is getting uglier. Amazon took to its blog early Wednesday to hit back at “inaccurate and misleading” criticisms from Sen. Bernie Sanders in an unusual political post from the tech giant. The Independent Vermont senator penned a post of his own later in the day, renewing criticisms that the company does not pay employees enough and voicing concern over working conditions at fulfillment centers. “Bottom line: the taxpayers of this country should not have to subsidize employees at a company owned by Mr. Bezos who is worth $155 billion. That is absurd,” Sanders wrote. Amazon refuted the senator’s claims that it doesn’t pay lower-level employees a livable wage and therefore workers have to rely on government assistance programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), at the expense of other taxpayers. “Senator Sanders continues to spread misleading statements about pay and benefits,” representatives for the company wrote on its Day One blog. “Amazon is proud to have created over 130,000 new jobs last year alone. In the U.S., the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15/hour before overtime. We encourage anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers.” The company added that Sanders’ references to SNAP, “which hasn’t been called ‘food stamps’ for several years,” are misleading because they include part-time employees and those who only worked for the company for a short period of time – saying that these groups would “almost certainly qualify for SNAP.” Meanwhile, Sanders accused the company of being “less than forthcoming with information about their employment practices.” He said the company’s median pay is 9 percent less than the industry average at $28,446, and “well below” a livable wage. Sanders is expected to unveil legislation next week that would require large employers to cover the cost of federal assistance received by their employees through imposing a 100 percent tax on those benefits. The aim is to encourage companies, like Amazon, to pay higher wages and reduce the burden on the middle-class taxpayers that subsidize these programs. He recently created a survey for Amazon employees to ask whether they receive SNAP benefits, which the tech giant’s senior vice president of operations publicly encouraged employees to fill out. Recent reports, citing the New Food Economy, show that as many as one-third of Amazon’s employees in Arizona receive food stamps, as do one-in-10 in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Sanders has also criticized the company for alleged poor working conditions at some of its facilities. On Wednesday he said “there are deeply disturbing stories about working conditions at fulfillment centers run by Amazon and its contractors.” The company on Wednesday claimed that despite several invites, Sanders has not personally toured any of its fulfillment centers. Sanders noted he will be asking the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate the conditions at those centers, and will soon be visiting a facility.',

    'Amazon defends itself from Bernie Sanders'' attacks',
    'Life inside an Amazon fulfillment center Senator Bernie Sanders wants to slap a special tax on Amazon and other big companies that employ workers who collect food stamps and other public assistance. But Amazon disputes Sanders'' depiction, saying its pay and benefits are competitive with other retailers. The progressive icon from Vermont has been on the attack lately, posting a series of Facebook videos over the past week calling out Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) for not paying a living wage, which he lists in some posts as $15 an hour. In one video, titled "Get Amazon Off of Corporate Welfare," he highlighted that CEO Jeff Bezos is the world''s richest person and earns $260 million a day, while many of his workers are on food stamps. "Mr. Bezos continues to pay many thousands of his Amazon employees wages that are so low that they are forced to depend on taxpayer-funded programs, such as food stamps, Medicaid and subsidized housing in order to survive," Sanders said in the video, stressing that taxpayers foot the bill for these benefits. "Frankly, I don''t believe that ordinary Americans should be subsidizing the wealthiest people in the world because they pay their employees inadequate wages." The senator argues that Amazon''s median employee pay is $28,446, which he says is 9% less than the industry average and "well below what constitutes a living wage in the United States." Also, he says he believes that many of the company''s workers are either contractors or employed by temporary staffing agencies and earn even less. Sanders plans to introduce legislation next week that would levy a tax on large companies equal to the value of the government benefits their workers receive. He argues that if employers paid a living wage, taxpayers would save $150 billion a year on public assistance programs. Related: Bezos worth $150 billion as Amazon hits all-time high In addition, he posted a form on his Senate and Facebook pages urging Amazon employees to share their experiences working at the online retail titan and asking them whether they are on public assistance or struggle with demanding working conditions. Amazon, however, called Sanders'' assertions "inaccurate and misleading" in a blog post Wednesday. The company says that Sanders'' data for food stamp recipients includes people who only worked at Amazon for a short period of time or who chose to work part-time. The median U.S. salary for full-time Amazon employees is $34,123, it says. Sanders'' figure includes part-time employees and those who work globally. It has invited the senator to tour one of its fulfillment centers, which is where many of Amazon''s lower-paid employees work. The company highlighted that its average hourly wage for a full-time fulfillment center employee is more than $15 an hour, including cash, stock and incentive bonuses, but before overtime. Amazon also noted that it offers health and disability insurance, as well as retirement savings plans, company stock, tuition payments and up to 20 weeks of paid leave. The company says it created more than 130,000 new jobs in the U.S. last year. Related: Bernie Sanders is hosting a town hall for workers. Their CEOs are invited. "We encourage anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers," it wrote, encouraging workers to fill out Sanders'' form. Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    'California Close to enacting nation''s strongest net neutrality law',
    'California is taking net neutrality regulations into its own hands. State lawmakers voted to pass a bill restoring net neutrality protections Friday. If signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, it would ensure all California broadband customers have equal access to content on the internet. The law would be the strictest for internet providers in the United States, and put California at odds with the federal government. The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to overturn Obama-era net neutrality protections earlier this year. Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman appointed by President Donald Trump, pitched the repeal as a way to stop the federal government from "micromanaging the internet." "When Donald Trump''s FCC decided to take a wrecking ball to net neutrality protections, we knew that California had to step in to ensure our residents have access to a free and open internet," California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. "We hope that other states can look to this legislation as a model for net neutrality standards." The California bill prohibits internet providers from blocking, slowing down, or speeding up content from certain sites or apps. For example, a company could not give free speedy access to its own streaming service but slow down Netflix. Under the proposed rules, providers cannot charge companies fees for a better connection, or allow zero rating -- when a provider doesn''t count certain content against a plan''s data cap. It will now head to Governor Brown, who has until September 30 to veto the legislation or sign it into law. Brown has not publicly stated whether or not he will sign the bill, though it has broad support from state Democrats. The federal government could sue the state of California over the law, leading to an eventual showdown in the Supreme Court. The legislation has been championed by consumer advocacy groups, small businesses, and some technology companies including Sonos, Etsy and Reddit, but criticized by the telecom industry. Internet providers including Comcast and AT&T have lobbied against the law, and claim it could raise internet prices. AT&T is the parent company of CNN. Industry groups are urging Governor Brown to veto the bill. "The internet must be governed by a single, uniform and consistent national policy framework, not state-by-state piecemeal approaches," said Jonathan Spalter, President & CEO of USTelecom, a trade group representing broadband companies. "Governor Brown should use his veto pen on this legislation, and Congress should step in to legislate and provide consumer protections that will resolve this issue once and for all." Internet providers also argue it could lead to higher prices for consumers. "The ban on zero rating could lead to an increase of $30 a month on the bills of low income Californians and the ban on interconnection fees could lead to a reduction in investment in California by more than $1 billion a year," said an AT&T spokesperson in a statement. "We support an open internet, but this bill move us no closer to that." California would become the fourth state to pass its own net neutrality protections, but the largest and most consequential. Supporters of net neutrality rules have been fighting the FCC''s ruling on multiple fronts. In January, attorneys general of more than 20 states sued the FCC. Nearly three dozen other states are working on their own laws, and supporters hope California''s bill will inspire even more states to follow suit. The FCC did not reply to a request for comment. "If there''s one thing this victory in California shows it''s that Internet users are still royally pissed off about the FCC''s repeal of net neutrality. They''re still paying attention. And they''re not going to let their elected officials get away with selling out their constituents by siding with big telecom companies," said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, a non-profit consumer advocacy group. This is the second time California passed a major law regulating the internet this year. In June, it became the first state to pass internet privacy legislation, giving consumer more control over their personal data. It faced opposition from major technology players, including Facebook, (FB) Google (GOOG)and Amazon (AMZN). ',

    'California net neutrality bill clears key hurdle',
    'The California Assembly voted Wednesday to enshrine net neutrality in state law, delivering a major victory to advocates looking to require an equal playing field on the internet. In the latest effort by California lawmakers to drive national policy and rebuff President Donald Trump, lawmakers approved one of the nation''s most aggressive efforts to revive regulations repealed last year by the Federal Communications Commission. The rules prevented internet companies from exercising more control over what people watch and see on the internet. The 58-17 vote Thursday was surprisingly lopsided after the Assembly was seen as a potential barrier to the bill''s passage. It returns to the Senate, which passed an earlier version and is expected to sign off on changes from the Assembly before the Legislature adjourns on Friday. "We all know why we''re here. It''s pretty clear," said Assemblyman Miguel Santiago, a Los Angeles Democrat. "The Trump administration destroyed the internet as we know it." Opens a New Window. Sponsored by Finance Leadership Prog. Opens a New Window. Finance Leadership Prog. Opens a New Window. Be ready to take tech & your career, forward. Set a course for the future, by taking ours. The Assembly''s vote followed months of intense lobbying from internet companies, which warned that it would lead to higher costs. California''s net neutrality debate is being closely watched by advocates around the country, who are looking to the home of Silicon Valley to pass sweeping net neutrality provisions that could drive momentum in other states or create pressure for Congress to enact nationwide protections. "Net neutrality is not dead. It''s coming back with a vengeance," said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, an advocacy group that is pushing to preserve net neutrality. Internet providers say they''ve publicly committed to upholding the values of net neutrality, but strict rules like California''s would inhibit investment in faster technology. They say it''s unrealistic to expect them to comply with internet rules that vary across the country. "Consumers expect a single, national approach to keeping our internet open, not the confusing patchwork of conflicting requirements passed today, Jonathan Spalter, president & CEO the broadband industry group USTelecom, said in a statement. The California legislation "keeps the country strapped into a roller coaster ride of state net neutrality regulations," he said. The measure, if signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, is likely to face a legal challenge. The FCC has declared that states cannot pass their own net neutrality rules, though proponents of the California legislation say that only Congress can tie California''s hands. "President Trump didn''t ruin the internet. President Trump didn''t change the internet," said Melissa Melendez, a Republican from Lake Elsinore in Southern California. "You''re wading into an area where you have no business being." Six Republicans joined nearly all Democrats in supporting the legislation. Net neutrality advocates worry that, absent rules prohibiting it, internet providers could create fast lanes and slow lanes that favor their own sites and apps or make it harder for consumers to see content from their competitors. That could limit consumer choice or shut out upstart companies that can''t afford to buy access to the fast lane, critics worry. Santiago, who steered the bill through the Assembly, faced a flood of angry calls and online memes when a committee he leads briefly watered down the bill earlier this year. The stronger provisions were later restored. The bill, written by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, would prohibit internet providers from blocking or slowing data based on its content or from favoring websites or video streams from companies that pay extra. It also would ban so-called "zero rating," in which internet providers don''t count certain content against a monthly data cap. It would prohibit, for example, AT&T from exempting videos from CNN or other outlets it owns from a monthly data cap that applies to competitors. Critics say the ban on zero rating will raise cellphone bills and make it harder for poor people to access streaming video since it would all count against their monthly data allotment. Wiener says zero rating encourages smaller data allotments and makes it harder for people to access diverse online content.',
