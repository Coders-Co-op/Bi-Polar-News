      <div class="topic-items">America's news has become so polarized that we have become “a nation divided” - Red vs Blue. So, to promote national unity, the BiPolar News gives you the chance to see both sides of major news stories.

This app presents you with two articles on major news topics, one from a premier conservative news source and the other from a premier liberal news source. The BiPolar News lets you read and compare, with an eye out for biased reporting. </div>
